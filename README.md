# An autohotkey script to replace the default windows key search function with the powertoys alt + space search function.
Please note: It disables the windows key typical function including win + d/s/a/w for resizing windows etc... (potential change in the future to accomodate these standard features) It also changes the win + r function for run to alt + r.
