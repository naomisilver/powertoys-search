# Autohotkey scripts to replace typical key functionility with that of powertoys alt+space search.
capslocksearch.ahk replaces "caps lock" with the powertoys alt+space search.

winsearch.ahk replaces the windows key with the powertoys alt+space search.

Please note for winsearch.ahk: It disables the windows key typical function including win + arrow keys for resizing windows etc... It also changes the win + r function for run to alt + r. 

For either script to work you need to follow these steps:
1. Download autohotkey from: https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Download Microsoft's powertoys from: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/install
3. Once autohotkey has installed, navigate to the autohotkey folder (default is document/autohotkey/...) and drag in "winsearch.ahk" or "capslocksearch.ahk"
4. right click and open with "autohotkey launcher" and follow any additional downloads required from autohotkey.
5. to run on startup navigate to the autohotkey folder, right click the "winsearch.ahk" or "capslocksearch.ahk" file and create a shortcut.
6. press win+r (alt+r if the script is running) and type shell:startup and drag in the shortcut file in there.

Enjoy :)
